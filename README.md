## Project Overview

This repository contains my assessment project for [Insert Name of the Assessment/Project Here]. The assessment focused on data analysis and visualization, and it includes the following components:

1. Jupyter Notebook for Data Analysis: This notebook includes both descriptive and predictive data analysis, showcasing my data exploration, data preprocessing, and machine learning skills.

2. Power BI Project: I've also created a Power BI project with two interactive dashboards to visually represent the insights derived from the data analysis.

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. 

To use the Power BI project, follow these steps:

Download and install Power BI Desktop from the official website.
Open Power BI Desktop and open the project file located in the power_bi/ directory.
Interact with the dashboards to explore the data visualizations.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further information about the assessment project.
